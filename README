shadhavar meeting fosdem 2012. 

things to look at:
* VM's > are they a device? or how should we put them in te db. 
  - yes, they are a device; devices just aren't physical per se (in which case certain fields can be omitted)
* how to work with clusters / migrating vm's? 

Things to discuss:
* spreading the workload 
* make a list of features for version 1.0 :-)
* who will provide testing infrastructure
